    <SMN_AlertFullSkillServersDesc>There is no more capacity for skill points. Consider using them, or expanding capacity.</SMN_AlertFullSkillServersDesc>

	<SMN_AlertFullHackingServers>Full Hacking Servers</SMN_AlertFullHackingServers>
    <SMN_AlertFullHackingServersDesc>There is no more capacity for hacking points and there is no current time penalty. Consider using them, or expanding capacity.</SMN_AlertFullHackingServersDesc>

    <SMN_AlertLowSecurity>Network At Risk</SMN_AlertLowSecurity>
	<SMN_AlertLowSecurityDesc>The number of available security points is exceedingly unlikely to successfully defend against any attempted hacks! Additional security servers and points are required - extreme caution should be practiced around network use at this time.</SMN_AlertLowSecurityDesc>
